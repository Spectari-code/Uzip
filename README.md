# Uzip

## What this project is all about:

This is a simple python program/script to unzip all zipfiles in your downloads directory.
I started this project because I want something easy to use for repetitive tasks and python can be fun.

### TODO:

GUI to make it simple to run the program.
Unzip more than one file at a time.
